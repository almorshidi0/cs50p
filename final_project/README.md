## Description

This Python program implements a user-friendly flashcard application to aid in studying and memorizing information. It allows users to:

* **Create new flashcards:** Users can define new cards by entering questions and answers.
* **Load existing flashcards:** The app can load data from text files containing flashcards in a specific format.
* **Review flashcards:** The program presents flashcards in a randomized order, prompting users to answer questions. Based on their responses, the app adjusts the repetition frequency of each card, focusing on those requiring more practice.
* **Edit existing flashcards:** Users can modify the content of existing cards within the app.
* **Add new cards:** Users can continuously expand their flashcard collection by adding new questions and answers.
* **Track progress:** The app provides an overview of the user's progress, indicating the number of reviewed cards and those still requiring practice.

## Key Features

* **Simple and intuitive interface:** The program offers a user-friendly menu-driven interface for easy navigation and interaction.
* **Flexible data storage:** Flashcards are stored in plain text files, ensuring compatibility and portability across different systems.
* **Adaptive learning:** The app adjusts the repetition frequency of cards based on user performance, prioritizing cards that need more reinforcement.
* **Offline functionality:** The program operates entirely offline, eliminating the need for an internet connection.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. **Download the files:** Download the project files, including project.py, test_project.py, and requirements.txt.
3. **Run the program:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and execute `python project.py` or `python3 project.py`.

## Using the App

* The program prompts you to enter the filename for your flashcards. You can either specify an existing file or create a new one.
* The main menu offers options to review cards, add new cards, edit existing cards, track progress, or exit the program.
* When reviewing cards, the app displays the question and prompts you for an answer. Based on your response, it provides feedback and adjusts the card's repetition frequency.

## Customization

* You can modify the format of the flashcard text files to suit your specific needs.
* The program offers flexibility in adding new features and functionalities based on your preferences.

This flashcard app is a valuable tool for anyone seeking to enhance their learning and memory retention through an interactive and personalized approach.
